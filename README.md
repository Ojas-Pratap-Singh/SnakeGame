![Snake Game Demo](url/to/demo.gif) <!-- If you have a demo gif or screenshot, include it here -->
## Description

This project is a simple Snake Game developed using the Java Swing library. The game allows players to control a snake and make it eat food to grow in size and score points. The game ends when the snake collides with the border or its own body. The game provides the following functionalities:

- **Controlling the Snake**: Players can guide the snake's movement using arrow keys .
- **Eating Food**: The snake can consume food (represented by an apple) to increase its size and score points.
- **Increasing Size and Scores**: As the snake eats more food, it grows in size, and the player's score increases.
- **Ending the Game**: The game ends when the snake collides with obstacles, such as the border or its own body.

The game demo showcases a moving three-dot snake, with the head represented by a red dot, the body by green dots, and the apple as the food.

## Features

To create the Snake Game, the following features will be implemented:

1. **Basic UI**: The game will have a user interface with frames, content, a content pane, dimensions, and a background color.

2. **Graphics**: Graphics will be used to load images and draw components, such as the snake, apple, and game board, in their appropriate positions.

3. **Snake Mechanics**: The game will implement the mechanics of the snake, defining how it moves and consumes food.

4. **Control**: Players will control the snake's movement using arrow keys or other specified controls.

5. **Collision Detection**: The game will check for collisions with the border and the snake's body to determine when the game should end.

6. **Score and Game Over Display**: The game will display the player's score during gameplay and show a "Game Over" message when the game ends.
