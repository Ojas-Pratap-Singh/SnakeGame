# Snake Game using Java Swing

![Snake Game Demo](url/to/demo.gif) <!-- If you have a demo gif or screenshot, include it here -->

## Description

This project is a simple Snake Game developed using the Java Swing library. The game allows players to control a snake and make it eat food to grow in size and score points. The game ends when the snake collides with the border or its own body.

The game features include:

- **Basic UI**: The game window is created using Java Swing components, with appropriate dimensions and background color.
- **Graphics**: Images are loaded to represent the snake, food, and other components, and they are drawn on the window at their respective positions.
- **Snake Mechanics**: The snake moves continuously in a specific direction, and when it consumes food, it grows in size.
- **Control**: Players can control the snake's movement using arrow keys on their keyboard.
- **Collisions**: The game checks for collisions with the border and the snake's body to determine when the game should end.
- **Score Display**: The player's score is displayed on the screen during gameplay.
- **Game Over Message**: When the game ends, a "Game Over" message is displayed on the screen.
